                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization VI is a turn-based strategy 4X video game developed by Firaxis Games,
                    published by 2K Games, and distributed by Take-Two Interactive. The Mobile port was published by
                    Aspyr Media. The latest entry into the Civilization series, it was released on Microsoft Windows and
                    macOS in October 2016, with later ports for Linux in February 2017, iOS in December 2017, Nintendo
                    Switch in November 2018, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2019 and Android in 2020. Similar to
                    previous installments, the goal for the player is to develop a civilization from an early settlement
                    through many in-game millennia to become a world power and achieve one of several victory
                    conditions, such as through military domination, technological superiority, or cultural influence,
                    over the other human and computer-controlled opponents. Players do this by exploring the world,
                    founding new cities, building city improvements, deploying military troops to attack and defend from
                    others, researching new technologies and civics advancements, developing an influential culture, and
                    engaging in trade and negotiations with other world leaders. The game features several civilizations
                    not featured in previous incarnations of Civilization, while many returning civilizations have new
                    capitals or new leaders. A critical design focus was to avoid having the player follow a pre-set
                    path of improvements towards their civilization which they had observed from earlier games. New to
                    Civilization VI is the use of districts outside the city center to house most of the buildings. For
                    example, a campus district must be built in order to house science-based buildings. Other new
                    features include research on the game's technology tree based on nearby terrain, a similar
                    technology tree for cultural improvements and a better government civics structure for those playing
                    on a cultural victory path. There is also new artificial intelligence mechanics for
                    computer-controlled opponents, which includes secret goals and randomized engagements to disrupt an
                    otherwise stable game. The game received generally positive reviews upon release, and it was awarded
                    Best Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2016. The game's first major expansion, Civilization VI: Rise
                    and Fall, was released in February 2018. A second expansion, Civilization VI: Gathering Storm,
                    followed in February 2019, and a season pass, The New Frontier Pass, in May 2020.</p>

                <p>The game was developed by the same Firaxis Games team that developed the expansions on Civilization
                    V, and most of the new mechanics introduced in these were present in Civilization VI at its
                    launch. This follows from Sid Meier's "33/33/33" rule of sequel design: 33% of the game should
                    retain established systems, 33% should feature improved systems over the previous version, and the
                    remaining 33% should feature new material. Firaxis used "Frankenstein", a small group of
                    dedicated Firaxis fans, to bounce ideas for gameplay improvements. Because of the larger number
                    of systems in place, the studio expected to ship the game with a large-scale tutorial, separate but
                    supplementing the guidance given by the player's various in-game advisors. A major foundation of
                    the development of Civilization VI was to prevent players from following
                    routines in playing through a game, according to lead designer Ed Beach. The developers placed much
                    more emphasis on the significance of the procedurally-generated map in how it would influence the
                    player's strategy as the game progressed, so that no game of Civilization VI would be the same.
                    For example, the redesigned technology tree was aimed to pull players away from automatically
                    following a rote path through the tree, and instead adapt a path through it based on their placement
                    on the map.</p>
