## excercise descriptions

### [UE1](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE1)

Only some simple html, nothing else yet.

### [UE2](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE2)

We got a html file with some really stupid mistakes and had to correct all of them.

### [UE3](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE3)

We learned about br and hr.

### [UE4](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE4)

We learned how to ul and ol.

### [UE5](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE5)

Just like UE4.

### [UE6](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE6)

A simple webpage about the history of html which we had to make ourselves.
I did a lot of stuff which we hadn't yet learned.

### [UE7](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE7)

Nothing but some rather simple meta tag stuff.

### [UE8](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE8)

A news web page but bought on wish.
We had probably already learned some simple inline css at this point but definitely not nearly as much as I used.

### [UE9](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE9)

We had to make a shop, including several linked together html files.
Everyone was too stupid to do it fsr.

### [UE10](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE10)

Just some img tag stuff.
