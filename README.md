## excercise descriptions

### [UE1](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE1)

only some simple html, nothing else yet

### [UE2](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE2)

we got a html file with some really stupid mistakes and had to correct all of them

### [UE3](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE3)

we learned about br and hr

### [UE4](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE4)

we learned how to ul and ol

### [UE5](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE5)

just like UE4

### [UE6](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE6)

a simple webpage about the history of html which we had to make ourselves
I did a lot of stuff which we hadn't yet learned

### [UE7](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE7)

nothing but some rather simple meta tag stuff

### [UE8](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE8)

a news web page but bought on wish
we had probably already learned some simple inline css at this point but definitely not nearly as much as I used

### [UE9](https://github.com/MinihuberKonstantin/medt-excercises/tree/main/UE9)

we had to make a shop, including several linked together html files
everyone was too stupid to do it fsr
